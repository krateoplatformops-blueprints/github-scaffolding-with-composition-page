description: >
  This is a template used to scaffold a toolchain to host and deploy a fully functional frontend App.
  This Template implements the following steps:
  - Create an empty Github repository (on github.com)
  - Push the code from the skeleton to the previously create repository
  - A Continuous Integration pipeline (GitHub workflow) will build the Dockerfile of the frontend app and the resulting image will be published as a Docker image on the GitHub Package registry
  - An ArgoCD Application will be deployed to listen to the Helm Chart of the frontend app and deploy the chart on the same Kubernetes cluster where ArgoCD is hosted
  - The frontend App will be deployed with a Service type of NodePort kind exposed on the chosen port.
  - A Composition page in Krateo Composable Portal is available with composition informations

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
